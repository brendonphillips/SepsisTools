#' @param data_ the data set, with at least three features: event (what happened), id (who were they), group (what intervention were they administered)
#' @param ... currently ignored
#' @param group_col_name the name of the column with `group` information 
#' @param id_col_name the name of the column with participant/patient `id` information
#' @param event_col_name the name of the column with the event (data type castable to numerical)
#' @param ntrials the number of permutation tests performed (and test statistics calculated). currently capped at N!
#' @param parallel True/False whether the permutations/test statistics are to be calculated serially or in parallel (uses the R snow package) 
#' @param ranseed a set random seed to be used for the permutations (used for reproducibility)
#' @param systematic True/False whether the groups are to be grouped or distributed totally randomly. For example, should all observations from Patient A in group (G1) be permuted to the same group (G2), or can they be spread across permuted groups? The first option (TRUE) is endorsed by Eleanor, the second option (FALSE) would be in line with other R packages (`coin`, for example).
#' @param na_fill if any entries in the input table have empty groups, either (TRUE) fill them with a generated group name .NA_group, or (FALSE) filter those rows out.
#' @param verbose TRUE/FALSE whether a completion message with stats should be printed to the screen whenever the permutation test ends. A progress bar is printed in all cases.
